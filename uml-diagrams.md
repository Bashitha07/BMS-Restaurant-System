## üèóÔ∏è Class Diagram Details

### Core Entities
The system follows a well-structured entity model with proper inheritance and relationships:

#### Base Classes & Interfaces
- **`BaseEntity`** - Abstract base class with common fields (id, created, updated)
- **`Trackable`** - Interface for entities that need status tracking
- **`Payable`** - Interface for entities involved in payment processing

#### Main Entities
1. **User** - Customer and staff management
2. **Menu** - Food items and categories
3. **Order** - Order processing and management
4. **OrderItem** - Individual items within orders
5. **Payment** - Payment processing and records
6. **Reservation** - Table booking management
7. **Driver** - Delivery driver information
8. **Delivery** - Delivery tracking and management

#### Enumerations
- **UserRole**: CUSTOMER, ADMIN, DRIVER, KITCHEN_STAFF, MANAGER
- **OrderStatus**: PENDING, CONFIRMED, PREPARING, READY, OUT_FOR_DELIVERY, DELIVERED, CANCELLED
- **PaymentStatus**: PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED, REFUNDED
- **PaymentMethod**: CARD, CASH, ONLINE
- **ReservationStatus**: PENDING, CONFIRMED, SEATED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED, NO_SHOW
- **DeliveryStatus**: ASSIGNED, PICKED_UP, OUT_FOR_DELIVERY, DELIVERED, FAILED

### Relationship Types
- **Inheritance** (`--|>`): All entities extend BaseEntity
- **Interface Implementation** (`..>`): Order/Payment implement Payable; Order/Delivery implement Trackable
- **Composition** (`*--`): Order contains OrderItems and Payments (strong ownership)
- **Aggregation** (`o--`): User has Orders and Reservations (weak ownership)
- **Dependency** (`..>`): Entities depend on their respective enums
