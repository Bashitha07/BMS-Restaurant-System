# Frontend Development Server Start Instructions

To start the frontend development server correctly, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory inside the project root:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```
3. Install dependencies if not already installed:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/
   ```

This will ensure the dev server runs with the correct root directory and serves the React app properly.

If you encounter any errors, please share the terminal output for further assistance.
