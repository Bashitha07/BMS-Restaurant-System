# TODO: Fix Linter Errors in MenuItem.jsx

- [ ] Fix the badges section closing: Change the extra `)}` to `</div>` to properly close the badges div.
- [ ] Verify the outer div is properly closed and no stray tokens remain.
- [ ] Run the development server to ensure no build errors and linter warnings are resolved.
